# The irresistible rise of people-friendly, clean air cities

Cities around the world are moving to reduce traffic and cut the numbers of cars on roads. In many places this means walkways have been widened, roads have been rededicated to cyclists and pedestrians and the public have been incentivised to use public transport. In several places these measures added to, or grew out of already existing priorities to cut traffic, congestion and pollution. But why? Partly it is to allow for active forms of travel like walking and cycling but these efforts also produce more pleasant urban environments. But, vitally, as the impacts of the climate crisis become more and more apparent, it is also important for cities to play their part in reducing carbon emissions - emissions that also have a detrimental effect on health.

Time and time again whenever these proposals are made there comes a tide of outrage from a vocal minority. What is little-known about is that accompanying well-trodden path as to what happens next. Typically when the measures are introduced, the negatives outcried by critics never come about. People adapt their travelling habits, support gradually grows and the majority do not want to go back to how things were before.

Our mega-cities are in vital need of shifting away from cars. Of course some groups, such as those with personal mobility challenges, will still require vehicle access, but one of the best ways of meeting their needs will be clearing the roads of unnecessary cars. As the stories below show, people are remarkably good at adapting to change so as many look at leaving car culture behind, the future of better towns and cities is looking brighter.
